- RealmConfigurationManager class for loading settings from environment variables
- RealmAccessController class for permission validation and access control
- Support for MEGAMIND_PROJECT_REALM, MEGAMIND_DEFAULT_TARGET environment variables

**Dual-Realm Database Access**

- ✅ Completed: Implement basic dual-realm access in MCP server
- ✅ Completed: Test realm isolation and inheritance patterns

**Details**: Successfully implemented Phase 1 of the project realms architecture with:

**Database Infrastructure**:
- Fresh schema design with 5 SQL files (realm tables, enhanced core tables, session management, indexes/views, initial data)
- realm_id integration across all tables with proper foreign key constraints
- Performance indexes optimized for dual-realm queries
- Inheritance views for automatic Global → Project realm access

**Configuration Management**:
- Environment-based realm configuration (MEGAMIND_PROJECT_REALM, MEGAMIND_DEFAULT_TARGET)
- RealmConfigurationManager with validation and priority weighting
- RealmAccessController with permission validation
- Support for cross-realm search enablement/disablement

**Database Operations**:
- RealmAwareMegaMindDatabase class with dual-realm access patterns
- search_chunks_dual_realm() with Global + Project inheritance
- create_chunk_with_target() with realm assignment validation
- get_realm_hot_contexts() with realm priority weighting
- Automatic access count tracking across realms

**Testing Framework**:
- Comprehensive test suite with 4 test categories (all passed)
- Environment configuration scenario testing
- Database schema validation
- Permission system validation
- No database dependency for core functionality testing

**Key Architectural Decisions**:
- Environment-based configuration eliminates runtime realm switching complexity
- Fresh database approach avoids migration complexity
- Dual-realm search (Global + Project) provides natural inheritance
- Project realm gets 1.2x priority weighting over Global realm
- Permission system ensures proper isolation while allowing inheritance

Ready for Phase 2 implementation (semantic search integration) and eventual production deployment.
