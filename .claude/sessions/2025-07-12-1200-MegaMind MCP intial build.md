2. **Code Safety with Large Files**:
   - **Problem**: Need safe editing of large code files
   - **Solution**: Used textsmith `safe_replace_text` and `safe_replace_block` for all code modifications

3. **Model-Specific Optimization**:
   - **Problem**: Different AI models need different context strategies
   - **Solution**: Implemented model-type parameter with Sonnet/Opus/Claude-4 specific optimization logic

4. **Performance Monitoring Complexity**:
   - **Problem**: Need comprehensive monitoring without performance impact
   - **Solution**: Background thread collection with connection pooling and configurable intervals

**Dependencies Added**:
- **Core**: mysql-connector-python, mcp (Model Context Protocol)
- **Intelligence**: sentence-transformers, numpy, scikit-learn
- **Web**: Flask, Jinja2
- **Monitoring**: psutil (system metrics)
