## Progress

### Update - 2025-07-12 12:30 PM

**Summary**: Phase 1 complete - Core MegaMind MCP infrastructure fully implemented

**Git Changes**:
- Not a git repository (local development environment)
- Created complete project structure with 20+ files

**Todo Progress**: 7 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Create database schema design (megamind_chunks, chunk_relationships, chunk_tags tables)
- ✓ Completed: Build markdown ingestion tool (tools/markdown_ingester.py)  
- ✓ Completed: Create MCP server foundation with core functions (search_chunks, get_chunk, track_access)
- ✓ Completed: Set up MySQL database connection and Docker configuration
- ✓ Completed: Implement database indexes for performance optimization
- ✓ Completed: Add error handling and connection management
- ✓ Completed: Create validation tests for Phase 1 functionality

**Details**: Successfully executed Phase 1 of the Context Database System execution plan. Core infrastructure includes:

**Database Layer**:
- MySQL schema with 3 core tables and optimized indexes
- Session management tables for future bidirectional flow
- Sample data for validation
- Docker configuration with automated initialization

**Application Layer**:
- Markdown ingestion tool with semantic chunking
- Standalone MCP server with 4 core functions
- Connection pooling and error handling
- Comprehensive validation test suite

**DevOps Layer**:
- Docker Compose setup for MySQL, Redis, and MCP server
- Automated startup scripts for database and server
- Environment configuration templates
- Health checks and monitoring ready

**Files Created**:
- `database/context_system/` - 4 SQL files (schema, indexes, session tables, sample data)
- `tools/markdown_ingester.py` - 300+ line ingestion tool
- `mcp_server/megamind_database_server.py` - 400+ line MCP server
- `tests/test_phase1_validation.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `scripts/` - 3 operational scripts
- Docker configurations and documentation

**System Ready For**:
- Documentation ingestion from markdown files
- Semantic chunk search and retrieval
- Access pattern tracking and analytics
- Phase 2: Intelligence Layer development

The system targets 70-80% context reduction vs traditional markdown loading and enables practical Opus 4 usage for strategic analysis tasks.

### Update - 2025-07-12 14:00 PM

**Summary**: Phase 2 complete - Intelligence Layer with semantic analysis, analytics dashboard, and advanced MCP functions fully implemented

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: README.md, mcp_server/megamind_database_server.py, mcp_server/requirements.txt
- Added: analysis/ (semantic analyzer with sentence transformers)
- Added: dashboard/ (Flask analytics dashboard with visualizations)
- Added: scripts/run_semantic_analysis.sh, scripts/start_dashboard.sh
- Added: tests/test_phase2_intelligence.py
- Current branch: main (commit: d45b70e)

**Todo Progress**: 8 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- ✓ Completed: Create semantic analysis engine with sentence transformers for embedding generation
- ✓ Completed: Build context analytics dashboard with Flask for usage monitoring
- ✓ Completed: Enhance MCP server with advanced functions (get_related_chunks, get_session_primer, search_by_tags)
- ✓ Completed: Implement embedding storage and similarity search in database
- ✓ Completed: Add relationship discovery based on semantic similarity
- ✓ Completed: Create automated tagging system for chunk classification
- ✓ Completed: Build session primer integration with CLAUDE.md parsing
- ✓ Completed: Create validation tests for Phase 2 intelligence features

**Details**: Successfully executed Phase 2 of the Context Database System execution plan. Intelligence Layer includes:

**Semantic Analysis Engine** (`analysis/semantic_analyzer.py`):
- Sentence transformers integration (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model)
- Batch embedding generation for documentation chunks
- Automated relationship discovery based on semantic similarity
- AI-driven tag classification system with confidence scoring
- Support for multiple relationship types (references, depends_on, enhances, implements, supersedes)

**Analytics Dashboard** (`dashboard/context_analytics.py` + templates):
- Flask web application with real-time visualizations
- Usage heatmap showing hot/warm/cold chunks
- Relationship network visualization with D3.js integration
- Search pattern analysis and efficiency metrics
- Tag distribution charts and system health monitoring
- Responsive design with Plotly.js charts

**Enhanced MCP Server** (updated `mcp_server/megamind_database_server.py`):
- `mcp__megamind_db__search_by_embedding()` - Semantic similarity search
- `mcp__megamind_db__search_by_tags()` - Tag-based chunk retrieval
- `mcp__megamind_db__get_session_primer()` - CLAUDE.md-aware context generation
- Fallback mechanisms for graceful degradation
- Enhanced error handling and logging

**Intelligence Features**:
- Embedding storage in MySQL JSON columns
- Cosine similarity calculations for semantic search
- Automated tagging with subsystem/function_type/language classification
- Session continuity through CLAUDE.md parsing
- Relationship strength scoring and confidence metrics

**Operational Tools**:
- `./scripts/run_semantic_analysis.sh` - Automated embedding generation
- `./scripts/start_dashboard.sh` - Analytics dashboard launcher
- Comprehensive Phase 2 test suite with mocked dependencies
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows

**Performance Enhancements**:
- Batch processing for embedding generation (32 chunks per batch)
- Similarity threshold filtering (configurable, default 0.7)
- Connection pooling for dashboard analytics
- Graceful fallback to text search when embeddings unavailable

**System Status**:
- Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
- Phase 2: Intelligence Layer ✅ COMPLETED  
- Ready for Phase 3: Bidirectional Flow development

The system now provides advanced semantic search capabilities, visual analytics for usage patterns, and intelligent context assembly optimized for both Sonnet and Opus model usage patterns.
